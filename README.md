## LinkMe!
Discord: @gamenu


I code mostly in Python (my beloved ❤️) and Java, and know some C.

Favorite libraries and frameworks include:
- discord.py
- PaperMC
- Um
- Pain
- [fuckit.py](https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy)
- Android development

I may learn JS and WebDev at some point...

And that point is NEVER!!!

AAAHAAAHAHAHA!

I depracate repositories faster than Sonic on Coke, but I usually don't private them, feel free to fork 'em! (Keep in mind repositories' licensing terms, 

(Still waiting for pip to install a single package)
