Discord: @gamenu


I code mostly in Python (my beloved ❤️) and Java, and know some C.

Favorite libraries and frameworks include:
- discord.py
- PaperMC
- Um
- Pain
- [fuckit.py](https://github.com/ajalt/fuckitpy)
- Android development

I may learn JS and WebDev at some point...

And that point is NEVER!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I depracate repositories faster than Sonic on Coke, but I usually don't private them, feel free to fork 'em (according to repositories' licensing terms, usually GPL v3)!
