HAi I am *GaMeNu* welcome to whatever the hell this is.

I code mostly in Python (my beloved ❤️) and Java, and know some C.

Favorite libraries and frameworks include:
- discord.py
- PaperMC
- Um
- Pain
- Android development

I may learn JS and WebDev at some point...

I depracate repositories faster than Sonic on Coke, but I usually don't private them, feel free to fork 'em (according to repositories' licensing terms, usually GPL v3)!
